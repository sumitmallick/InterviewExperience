Q1 - Algorithm/Coding in Java - Ask any 1


Question

Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] and a key, write a function to find the key in the array where the array index starts from 0. The expected time complexity is O(Logn). 

Example:  
Input: arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}, key = 3 
Output: Found at index 8

Input: arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}, key = 30 
Output: Not found

Input: arr[] = {30, 40, 50, 10, 20}, key = 10   
Output: Found at index 3 



Question

Given an array of distinct integers and a sum value. Find the count of triplets with a sum smaller than the given sum value. The Expected Time Complexity is O(n2).

Example:  
Input: arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
        sum = 2.
Output: 2
Explanation:  Below are triplets with sum less than 2
               (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3) 

Input: arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
        sum = 12.
Output: 4
Explanation:  Below are triplets with a sum less than 12
               (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7), and 
               (1, 4, 5)




Question

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to print level order traversal in a way that nodes of all levels are printed in separate lines.

Example:  
Input:

Output:
20
8 22
4 12
10 14

Input:
          1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \  
  4     5 

Output:
1
2 3
4 5


Question

Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time complexity is O(Logn) 

Example:  
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 2
Output: 4 // x (or 2) occurs 4 times in arr[]

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 3
Output: 1 

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 1
Output: 2 

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 4
Output: -1 // 4 doesn't occur in arr[]
